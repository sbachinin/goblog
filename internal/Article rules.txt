==== Article rules

First line of type "# Some Text" will become a "title" displayed in the list view
First line of type "## Some Text" will become a "subtitle" displayed in the list view

If there is no "title",
    article will not be shown in a list view
    and in the article view there will be a message of kind "this article is not written yet"

"Content" is any non-empty lines anywhere in article's .md file which don't begin with #, ## or ----
If there is at least 1 such line, it means that "there is content"
>>> Therefore if article consists only of headings, it will be considered empty
If there is "no content",
    conseqences are the same as when no title.

If there is not "subtitle", it's just not rendered. Article at large is rendered.
